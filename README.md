## Project Overview

This project is a continuation of my Stage 0 task, where I built a **profile card kit**. For **Stage 1**, I enhanced it to a **multi-page dashboard** with SPA-like navigation.

### Home Page

- Contains the **profile card kit** from Stage 0.
- Added a **navigation bar** to move between pages without full reloads.
- Navigation links: **Home**, **About**, **Contact Us**.
- SPA navigation achieved using **Vanilla JavaScript**.

### About Page

- Reflective page with my personal thoughts for the HNG program.
- Sections with proper **data-testid attributes**:
  - Bio — `test-about-bio`
  - Goals in this program — `test-about-goals`
  - Areas of low confidence — `test-about-confidence`
  - Note to future self — `test-about-future-note`
  - Extra thoughts — `test-about-extra`
- Styled professionally with **Tailwind CSS** using my accent colors.
- Fully responsive.

### Contact Us Page

- Contains a **contact form** with validation.
- Required fields: Name, Email, Subject, Message.
- Shows a **toast modal** on successful submission.
- Sections and fields include **data-testid attributes** for testing.
- Fully responsive and styled using **Tailwind CSS**.
